CertNanny FAQ

* CA and SCEP server software requirements

Q: Any special considerations on the CA side?
A: The CA must not modify the requested DN, in particular adding the
   request serial number or other data to the issued certificate DN
   does not work. Disable this in the CA configuration.
   You should allow issuance of multiple certificates with the same DN
   in the CA configuration.

Q: Which CA software (SCEP servers) are supported?
A: The following CA software packages are currently supported:
   - OpenXPKI (0.9 or higher): http://www.openxpki.org/
   - OpenCA 0.9.2.4 (or higher): http://www.openca.info/legacy/index.html


* CA specific issues

Q: OpenCA: How do I set up the SCEP server properly?
A: Make sure your SCEP server is set up properly (SCEP certificate is
   configured, private key saved without password, dummy password specified 
   in the configuration)
   - OpenCA scep.conf:
     ScepAllowRenewal "YES"

Q: OpenCA: How do I enable automatic approval with existing private key?
A: - CertNanny keystore section:
     keystore.<label>.scepsignaturekey = old
   - OpenCA scep.conf:
     ScepAutoApprove "YES"


* Installation

Q: Which version of sscep do I need?
A: sscep version 20040325 (http://www.klake.org/~jt/sscep/) is known
   to work, but it does NOT support automatic approval of the new request
   based on the existing key.
   Apply contrib/sscep.patch.gz to the sources to build a version
   that allows automatic approval.

Q: What is gsk6cmd?
A: Trust me, you really don't want to know! (It's a command line tool
   for maintaining IBM GSKit keystores which is sometimes ... let's say
   not very intuitive.)

Q: Do I need gsk6cmd?
A: Unless you want to renew IBM GSK certificates, no.


* Operating and maintenance

Q: sscep fails miserably
A: Are you sure you are NOT using OpenSSL 0.9.7d?

Q: sscep refuses to accept the generated certificate
A: It has been observed that OpenSSL 0.9.7a can cause problems. Check
   again with the latest OpenSSL 0.9.7 version.

Q: CertNanny fails during renewal with "PRNG not seeded" or 
   "unable to write 'random state'" error message.
A: You need to define the OpenSSL RANDFILE environment variable/config 
   setting with a writable file. See http://www.openssl.org/support/faq.cgi#USER1 
   for more details.

Q: Can I reset the renewal state of a certain keystore?
A: The renewal state (including the new key and request) is stored
   in 'statedir'.
   To start over with the keystore with the label 'foo'
   (keystore.foo.location = ...)
   simply remove statedir/foo*
   It is safe to remove the contents of the state directory entirely
   between invocations. CertNanny will then restart with the renewal
   process from scratch.
   Note that depending on CA policy the SCEP server may reject new
   requests for a DN for which a request is already pending, so it
   might be a good idea to clean up on the CA side as well.
