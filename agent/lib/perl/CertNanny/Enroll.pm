=over 4

=item new()

Create a new "enroller" to act upon. Implementation should get global options and store data for execution. Anything that is needed between runs should be passed here.
A single instance per certificate should be created. It is up to the application user (not the implementer) to make sure a single instance is used per certificate.

=item enroll()

Implement the certificate enrollment (renewal) process. Can support initial enrollment, refer to documentation of implementation.

=item getCA()

Command to retrieve current valid CA ceritficates from the server.

=item getNextCA()

Root Key Roll-Over. Implement this to provide functionality for automatic renewal of root CA certificates.
