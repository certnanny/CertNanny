This document describes how to install the program.

Please read the README file for an introduction to this software and
for configuration documentation. To build the README run `make' in the
CertNanny source directory.


Prerequisites

In order to run this software you will need 
- Perl 5.6.1 or higher
- OpenSSL 0.9.7 (does NOT work with 0.9.7d!) or 0.9.8
- sscep Release 20040325 (http://www.klake.org/~jt/sscep/)
  sscep patches to these sources are included in this distribution,
  see the contrib/ directory.

On Win32 platforms you will also need
- Win32 Daemon 5006 (perl ppm.pl install http://www.roth.net/perl/packages/win32-daemon.ppd)
- CAPICOM 2.1.0.1 (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=860ee43a-a843-462f-abb5-ff88ea5896f6&DisplayLang=en)


3rd party tool installation

- Make sure OpenSSL is installed on your system. It is not recommended
  to use OpenSSL 0.9.7d to avoid problems with sscep. 0.9.7a, c, e and g
  are known to work. 

- Compile sscep. You will need the OpenSSL development libraries for this.

  It is recommended to apply the patch included in the contrib/ directory
  to create a sscep binary that supports automatic approval.
  See contrib/README for details.

  IMPORTANT: DO NOT COMPILE sscep WITH OPENSSL 0.9.7d
  If you are using OpenSSL 0.9.7d on your system, make sure you
  compile sscep STATICALLY with a version different than 0.9.7d.

  Problems have been observed with OpenSSL 0.9.7a. If sscep is compiled
  against this version, it may happen that sscep does not recognize
  the certificate fetched from the SCEP server to match with its request.
  This is due to different ASN.1 encodings of the Subject Name in
  request and certificate. Although the string represented by these
  encodings are the same, sscep may complain that the downloaded certificate
  does not match the request.
  If this behaviour is observed it is recommended to use the latest
  OpenSSL 0.9.7 version available.


Program installation
- run make create documentation files:
  make
- copy the bin/certnanny binary to a location of your choice, e. g.
  /usr/local/bin/ or ~/bin/
- copy the lib directory to a library directory where Perl can
  find it:
  cp -a lib /usr/local             (for system-wide installation)
  or
  cp -a lib ~/                     (for a user-only installation)
- it is recommended to have the following directory layout:
  <prefix>/bin/certnanny
  <prefix>/lib/perl/...
  <prefix>/lib/java/...

  The reason is that the certnanny binary automatically detects its
  Perl modules and Java tools if the directory layout is similar to 
  this without requiring special configuration via PERL5LIB or similar.


Check installation:

- make sure the Perl interpreter can access the newly installed library
  by running the certnanny without any options binary to check if the
  software was installed properly

If Perl complains that it "can't locate CertNanny.pm in @INC" the
lib/perl files are not found by the Perl interpreter.

To remedy this situation you can set PERL5LIB to the corresponding
directory:

export PERL5LIB="<path>"

Replace <path> with the installation directory from above where
CertNanny.pm can be found.

Rerun the program and verify that it outputs a usage note.

CertNanny is now ready for use.
