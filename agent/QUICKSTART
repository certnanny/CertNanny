Getting CertNanny up and running

Please read the full documentation in README and refer to the FAQ file 
when experiencing problems.


- Follow the instructions in the INSTALL file to install the software.

- Make sure you compiled and installed the sscep binary
  It is recommended to read the contrib/README file before compiling sscep.

- Using etc/certnanny.cfg as template, create a configuration file
  - make sure you specify the correct paths
  - configure at least one keystore
  - MAKE SURE you configured at least one Root CA Certificate used in 
    your environment

- Run 
  certnanny --cfg <yourconfigfile> check
  to test if everything is set up properly

- To test the renewal action edit the config file and modify the 
  'autorenew_days' setting. Set a value that is higher than your normal
  certificate validity period, so CertNanny will always think it's time
  to renew the certificate.

- Run
  certnanny --cfg <yourconfigfile> renew
  to run the renewal process

- If CertNanny's invocation of sscep reports PENDING twice, a new
  request should be visible in your CA system.

- Rerun 
  certnanny --cfg <yourconfigfile> renew
  and check that PENDING is reported again (this simulates periodic
  invocation by cron or similar)

- In the CA issue the certificate based on the new request.
  Make sure that you do NOT modify the requested DN, sscep will
  reject the certificate otherwise.

- Rerun 
  certnanny --cfg <yourconfigfile> renew
  This time CertNanny should find the new certificate on the server,
  download it and create a new keystore from it (sscep message "SUCCESS").

- Finetune the 'hook' definitions to act upon certain events (e. g. restart
  your server or notify an administrator)

- Set up a cron job for periodic invocation (recommended interval: once a 
  day).
