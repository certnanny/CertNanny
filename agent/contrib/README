* sscep

sscep is a command line SCEP client, available at
http://www.klake.org/~jt/sscep/

The official version published on this web site implements an older SCEP 
draft which does not support signing a request with an existing key.
This version works properly with CertNanny, but automatic approval
will NOT work.

To build an sscep binary that supports automatic approval, either use
the sscep-ng.tar.gz sources or patch your downloaded sscep sources
using sscep-ng2.patch.gz and sscep-non-unix.patch.gz. 

To create RPMs use sscep.spec.


* ExtractKey

Source code for the ExtractKey Java class (see lib/java/) is contained
in ExtractKey.tar.gz.

* Wizard

Wx::Perl based wizard to automatically generate a configuration file under Windows OS (for now).
Expects the path to the CertNanny installation as argument.
