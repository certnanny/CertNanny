# About the CertNanny OpenSource version and this repository

CertNanny was originally developed as an OpenSource client side agent for renewing and enrolling keystores using the SCEP protocol.

CertNanny development started in 2006 and development continued until about 2014.

Development has stopped on the OpenSource code base of CertNanny, and there will be no further development on this code base. There will also be no bug fixes, incident management or user support on this OpenSource variant.

**It is not recommended to base new infrastructure on the contents of this repository.**

In order to retain the code base of this project we keep all existing branches and commits of the project intact.

You will find the original unmodified repository contents in the [master branch of the repository](https://github.com/certnanny/CertNanny/tree/master). 



-----

Some of the original developers of the CertNanny OpenSource project have implemented a [commercial and closed-source rewrite of CertNanny](https://www.whiterabbitsecurity.com/produkte/certnanny/) which adopts the basic ideas of the project in a completely new code base.
